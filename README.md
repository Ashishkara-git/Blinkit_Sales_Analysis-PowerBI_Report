## Suggestions

1. Low-fat items currently account for approximately 65% of total sales, while regular items represent 35%. It is recommended that the client prioritize inventory optimization to align with this demand distribution, ensuring efficient stock management and maximizing sales potential.

2. The top-selling items include fruits and vegetables, snacks, and household products, while the least sold items are starchy foods, hard drinks, and seafood. To boost sales of these lower-performing categories, the client can implement strategies such as offering targeted discounts and enhancing item visibility on their online platform. These initiatives can encourage consumer interest and drive higher sales across all product categories.

3. Tier 1 cities typically generate higher sales due to larger populations and disposable incomes. To capitalize on the growth potential in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, the client can implement promotional discounts to attract price-sensitive consumers and utilize localized advertising to enhance brand visibility. These strategies can drive sales growth and help build a loyal customer base in these emerging markets.

4. Medium-sized outlets are achieving higher sales than small or large outlets, primarily in Tier 1 cities. Meanwhile, small-sized outlets are outpacing large ones in sales, mainly in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. This reflects distinct consumer preferences across different outlet sizes and market tiers.
